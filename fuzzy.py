# temp - 0-4 degrees celcius - long time - 6 months 
# high temp - fan speed full, water sprinkler on
# low temp - heater on, fan off
# temp - 25 - 30 degrees celcius - short time - 3-4 months
# humidity - 65 - 70% relative humidity ideal around 67%
# if humidity is too low, water sprinkler is needed, fan low speed
# if humidity is too high, heat sensor, and full speed fans is needed 
# gases - co2, h2s, c2h4 released when fruit is rotting - measure amount of gas in graph if anomaly or sudden jump give alert.
